COFFEE BEAN HUB/Data Visualizaion Project

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
The project aims to help users visualize the origins of coffee beans from around the world and understand how geographical factors influence the flavor profile of coffee. 
The interactive features are used to create comparisons between regions with different climates and how they affect the flavor of the coffee produced.

INTERACTIVE FEATURES:
Coffee Flavor Wheel and Profiles:
Randomized wheel to help visualize the flavor profile of beans from the top 8 coffee bean producing countries. Spin the wheel for a random message that displays the flavor profile, 
roasting suggestions, and brewing suggestions of the choosen country.
Interactive Coffee Bean Map:
Use Leaflet.js or Google Maps API to create an interactive map showing coffee bean origins. Mark coffee-producing regions across continents (e.g., Colombia, Ethiopia, Brazil).
Allow users to click on a region to get more detailed information about that region’s coffee, such as flavor profiles, production methods, and altitude.
Users could explore coffee-growing regions, see what flavors are typical of certain countries, and compare beans from different origins.
Coffee Production and Export:
Heat map that allows users to filter by year or region to see how production has changed over time.
Coffee and Climate Visualization:
Leaflet.js map displaying the reagion of the top producing coffee beans Arabica and Robustia.

ETHICAL CONSIDERATION:
In this project, we prioritized ethical considerations by ensuring transparency and fairness in the representation of coffee production data. 
The data sources we used were thoroughly vetted to include reliable information about coffee-growing regions, production methods, and flavor profiles.
We ensured that our visualizations did not misrepresent any regions, and we strived to present accurate, contextualized data that highlights both the diversity and challenges faced by coffee producers.
Additionally, we aimed to address sustainability concerns in the coffee industry by incorporating data related to ethical practices such as fair trade and eco-friendly certifications. 
This allows users to explore coffee origins while being mindful of environmental and social impacts. We ensured that no sensitive or personal data was used in this project, respecting privacy and data protection norms throughout the development process.


Dataset Sources:
Specialty Coffee Association (SCA): The Coffee Taster’s Flavor Wheel is a great reference for identifying key flavor notes from coffee beans. You can find data on coffee flavor profiles for different regions.
CoffeeAPI or World Coffee Research: These APIs or databases offer information about coffee beans from different origins, including details about the farms, regions, and types of beans.
Kaggle Datasets: You might find relevant coffee-related datasets on Kaggle, such as coffee quality reviews or information on coffee plantations.
OpenStreetMap or Google Maps APIs: For geolocation data to map coffee origins accurately.
